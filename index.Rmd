## The Storm App

The Storm App lets you check the financial and human impact weather events have had on states in the United States between 1950 to 2011.

Simply choose whether you wish to check the financial impact of weather events by selecting: 

- Property Damage
- Crop Damage or
- Property and Crop Damage combined

Or choose the human impact of weather events by selecting: 

- Fatalities
- Injuries or
- Fatalities and Injuries combined

## Slide 2

Why is it not working?


```{r nvd3plot, results = 'asis', comment = NA, message = F, echo = F}
require(rCharts)
storm <- read.csv("finalstorm.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")
storm <- subset(storm, variable=="Injuries")
n1 <- nPlot(value ~ Year, data = storm, group = 'State', type = 'lineChart')
n1$show('inline')
```
